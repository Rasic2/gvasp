Before install the :program:`GVasp`, we strongly recommend you to install `conda <https://anaconda.org/>`_ before.

After install conda, create a new environment, e.g. gvasp, and install a python (version=3.9), using following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n gvasp python=3.9

.. note::
    The conda tool can modify its original mirrors by modify the :file:`~/.condrc`, for example, :download:`.condrc-example <./.condrc>`

.. note::
    The pip tool can modify its original mirrors by add a :file:`~/.pip/pip.conf`, for example, :download:`pip.conf-example <./pip.conf>`
